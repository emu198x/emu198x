### Prompt 1

Claude, I believe we've just finished getting all of the SingleStep tests working for the 68000. We had planned to get the Amiga emulator booting to Kickstart 1.3

### Prompt 2

I think we already had a plan written that describes what the goal is, broken down into phases. Please look for that first

### Prompt 3

Let's review and revise all of the plans to be sure they're accurate. The amiga-variants-plan is still the baseline goal though

### Prompt 4

Let's actually start by removing the older CPU crates completely now

### Prompt 5

I think we need to make a plan that includes the consolidation. I don't even mind if we create another brand new emu-amiga-N crate that combines the working parts of each, but the goal is still 100% get a booting emulator
