Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Fix Blitter LINE mode bit assignments

## Context

The insert-disk screen bitmap doesn't match FS-UAE. The display pipeline is verified correct (palette, colors, 200-line output all match). The problem is in the Blitter LINE mode — every line is drawn with the wrong octant because BLTCON1 bit assignments are shifted by one position.

## Root Cause

The HRM (Appendix A, line draw mode) defines BLTCON1 LINE mode as:

| Bit | Name | Our code reads |
|-----|------|---------------|
| 4   | SUD  | SING (0x0010) |
| 3   | SUL  | SUD (0x0008)  |
| 2   | AUL  | SUL (0x0004)  |
| 1   | SING | AUL (0x0002)  |
| 0   | LINE | LINE (correct) |

Every control bit is shifted one position down. All octant directions are wrong.

## Fix

**File**: `crates/emu-amiga-rock/src/lib.rs` — `execute_blit_line()`

Change the bit masks from:
```rust
let sing = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0010 != 0;  // bit 4 — WRONG
let sud  = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0008 != 0;  // bit 3 — WRONG
let sul  = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0004 != 0;  // bit 2 — WRONG
let aul  = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0002 != 0;  // bit 1 — WRONG
```

To:
```rust
let sud  = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0010 != 0;  // bit 4
let sul  = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0008 != 0;  // bit 3
let aul  = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0004 != 0;  // bit 2
let sing = agnus.bltcon1 & 0x0002 != 0;  // bit 1
```

Also update the docstring comment (lines ~690-696) which has the same wrong mapping.

Keep the X direction fix (SUL=0 → increase pixel_bit = right, SUL=1 → decrease = left) and Y direction (SUD=0 → add row_mod = down, SUD=1 → subtract = up). These were verified correct against the HRM octant table and the graphics library's Draw() function.

## Verification

```
AMIGA_KS13_ROM=roms/kick13.rom cargo test -p emu-amiga-rock --test boot_kickstart test_boot_kick13 -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Compare `test_output/amiga_boot.png` with FS-UAE reference:
- Hand holding floppy disk, centered in display
- Upside-down text "AMIGA Work bench" on disk label (correct per design)
- "V 1.3" right-side-up below the hand
- White background, black outlines, blue disk body, grey slider

Did you actually write the new image - because the background still looks black to me

## Summary of changes

### `/Users/stevehill/Projects/Emu198x/crates/emu-amiga-rock/src/lib.rs`

1. **Removed `MASTER_TICK` static and its store call in `tick()`** -- The `pub static MASTER_TICK: std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64` declaration was removed, along with the `MASTER_TICK.store(...)` call at the top of `Amiga::tick()`.

2. **Removed COP1LCH/COP1LCL write eprintln traces** -- The `0x080` and `0x082` register handlers were changed from block expressions with `eprintln!` calls back to simple comma-terminated assignment arms.

3. **Reduced BLIT trace limit from 200 back to 30** -- Both `if count <= 200` checks (one for the main blit trace, one for the LINE mode trace) were reverted to `if count <= 30`.

4. **LINE mode fix preserved** -- The SUD/SUL/AUL/SING bit assignments at bits 4/3/2/1 of BLTCON1 remain intact (lines 745-748).

### `/Users/stevehill/Projects/Emu198x/crates/emu-amiga-rock/src/memory.rs`

5. **Removed the `// No watchpoint` comment** -- The `write_byte` function now has a plain `self.chip_ram[addr as usize] = val;` without the debug comment.

### `/Users/stevehill/Projects/Emu198x/crates/emu-amiga-rock/tests/boot_kickstart.rs`

6. **Removed `display_done_tick` and `early_screenshot_saved` variables** -- Both declarations removed from the variable block at the start of the test.

7. **Removed the `display_done_tick` assignment** in the `0x00FE896C` match arm, simplifying it to a single `eprintln!` line.

8. **Removed the early screenshot capture block** -- The entire block that saved `amiga_boot_early.png` when `display_done_tick > 0` was removed.

9. **Removed the COP1LC memory dump block** -- The diagnostic section that iterated 32 entries from `cop1` was removed, along with the `cop1` variable.

10. **Removed the `Agnus BPL1PT/BPL2PT` print and `RAM at $0000` print** -- Both lines removed from the diagnostic section.

11. **Reverted COP2LC dump to 8 entries** -- Changed from "COP2LC full dump" with 40 entries to "COP2LC dump" with 8 entries.

12. **Kept `let ram = &amiga.memory.chip_ram;`** in its current position (line 866, before the `cop2lc` usage).</result>
